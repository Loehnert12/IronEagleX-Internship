# Titanic Survival Analysis
## Summary
This is my streamlit application where I took passenger data from the Titanic, cleaned it up, and made some interactive visualization models with that data.

## Filters Page
I made two different filters as you can see below. The first filter I created allows you to search through the different categories for certain passengers. You can search by their gender, passenger class, survival status and their name or ticket number.

This next filter is a distribution filter that I added where you can select from a drop down menu either passenger class, gender, and survival status to get a count of passengers in that category you selected.

## Visualization Page
This page in the application has some interactive charts/graphs that show the data in a different way. This first chart here is a pie chart that shows the percentage of who survived compared to those who died.

This next bar graph just shows the survivability percentage by gender. You can see that the survivability for Males (blue bar) is drastically lower than the survival rate for Females (white bar).

Now here you can see the survival rates by passenger class.

And the last interactive chart I want to show is where the passengers embarked from. I took the embarked infomraation from the data and plotted out an interactive graph that shows the amount of passengers that embarked the Titanic at that location.

## Conclusion
We all know the story of the Titanic and that a lot of people perished that day. This application was my first one that I created trying to tell a story of that data through interactive graphs and charts. 

There are going to be more filters and graphs added throughout the next few weeks and months so stay tuned to what is new. Thank you for checking out my Titanic application.
